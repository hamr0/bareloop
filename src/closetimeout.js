// hamr's ruling (2026-09-06, verbatim): "both … autoset and can be override,
// same like api pricing" — the guesstimate-plus-loud-sign-plus-customer-
// override shape, never a hidden knob. Today `runClose`'s own default
// (`src/ralph.js:221`, `timeoutMs = 120_000`) is a defaulted cap with no
// operator-set floor — the same shape the wall's no-default rule already
// forbids for `maxWallMs`. This module is the fix: measure the close's own
// stages once at $0, before any provider call, and derive a per-stage ceiling
// from what was actually measured, unless the signed spec names one itself.
//
// CONSTANTS BELOW ARE ARBITER CONSTANTS — hamr set them 2026-09-07, verbatim:
// "floor = 120,000 ms; K = 5 ('2 and 5 are fine')." Never agent- or
// adopter-settable; a build changing them is arbiter territory, not a tuning
// knob a drafted spec or a runner script can reach for.
