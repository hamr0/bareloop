When a job line (or its ~ rule) names a priority or a label (for example "only priority P1 tickets", "only tickets with priority P1 count", "only issues labelled bug"), you MUST add a top-level "ticketFilter" beside "stages": ${TICKET_FILTER_EXAMPLE}. "priority" is a list of values from P0 to P3, "labels" is a list of label names; each key is optional, and at least one is required. Never invent a label: use only the names the job lines give. Leave "ticketFilter" out entirely when no job line names a priority or a label.
The filter decides whether a run starts, not whether the work is good, so it is not a check. The job line that names the priority or label has no stage: list it under "refused" with the reason "decided by the ticket filter before the run starts" AND add the ticketFilter: the refused entry alone does not filter anything, only the ticketFilter does. A person reads and signs the filter; you never set the job's server or tools.`;
