// PRD item 28's parked (a/b) ruling, hamr's verbatim call: "do a/b as a
// fallback, and verify/validate + no regression." A vendor HTTP 429 is a
// response — the provider answered, unlike src/transport.js's no-response
// class — but unlike every other status this repo already declines to retry
// (4xx/5xx generally, F115's own boundary), a 429 carries the ONE piece of
// information that turns "retry blindly" into "retry honestly": the vendor's
// own stated wait. This module is transport.js's SIBLING, not an extension
// of it — `isTransportFailure` must keep returning FALSE for anything
// carrying an HTTP status (429 included), and nothing here widens that.
//
// This is a FALLBACK, not the primary answer. The primary answer (F139,
// measured 2026-09-08) is picking a worker model with adequate rate
// headroom: gpt-4.1 = 30,000 TPM (429s deterministically on our workload,
// 2 of 2 runs), gpt-4.1-mini = 200,000 TPM, gpt-5-mini/gpt-5 = 500,000 TPM.
// One bounded retry only softens the failure mode when that primary answer
// was not followed (or headroom was still exceeded); it does not replace it.
