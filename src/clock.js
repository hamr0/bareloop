// T's wall clock — the shell's time instrument (PRD v1.27/v1.29; materials
// design record 2026-07-26, addenda 1 and 3).
//
// Time is arbiter territory with exactly `budgetUsd`'s status: operator input,
// the agent may tighten and never widen, never self-raised. The agent has no time
// field in the plan vocabulary at all (addendum 2), so nothing here is reachable
// from an agent-authored document — this module is read by the runner only.
//
// Three measured facts shape it, none of them assumed:
//
//   1. `loop.stop()` CANNOT cut an in-flight call. Measured (F61/C1): fired at
//      500ms against a 4,000ms hanging generate(), run() returned at 4,018ms.
//      bare-agent reads the flag at the round boundary (loop.js:661) and between
//      tool calls (:916). So a wall deadline is a BETWEEN-ROUND check, and
//      enforcement is `maxWallMs + closeStages × closeTimeoutMs` — reported, never
//      rounded down to the requested number (F6 in a time coat). The multiplier is
//      W5: a STAGED close (PRD v1.28) runs its stages one at a time and hands EACH
//      one the full `closeTimeoutMs` (`runStages` → `runClose`, ralph.js:257), so a
//      4-stage close at 900s is 60 minutes of close, not 15. The runner's own
//      outside watchdog already sized its stale window this way
//      (scripts/run-u.mjs: `CLOSE_TIMEOUT_MS * spec.close.length`); the clock
//      quoting the 1× number was the same arithmetic disagreeing with itself.
//      That figure counts ONE close, and the RUNNER is what holds both of its loops
//      to one: past the deadline it refuses to open a new fix iteration and stops on
//      the verdict the last close already minted (W-2), and it refuses to open a
//      STEP's attempt on the same reading — a step that would begin past the deadline
//      is never funded. Before that second refusal a step starting with zero time left
//      burned every attempt it was allowed (measured on the real flow: three attempts,
//      three judged exits, all past the deadline), because the variance meter scores a
//      step's time share against what the run had left when the step BEGAN and so is
//      structurally blind to a step that began with nothing.
//      It is still not a universal bound and is not claimed as one. Two overshoots
//      remain outside this number, both deliberate. A step ALREADY UNDER WAY when the
//      deadline trips finishes its attempt and runs its own exit checks (themselves
//      close stages, at the full timeout each): grading real work always completes, or
//      the run is unreadable after the money is spent. And that same mid-step deadline
//      still routes through the ONE replan — the meter's own terminal, unchanged — so
//      it pays a drafting call (floored at MIN_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS) before the new plan's
//      first step is the one refused.
//   2. BA-18's provider timeout is the only instrument that fires on the ABSENCE
//      of events. Measured (F61/C2): 1,259ms against a socket that accepts and
//      never answers; without it the bound is the OS TCP timeout (~2h). Deriving
//      it from the remaining budget is what stops the LAST round outliving the run.
//   3. ~90% accuracy is the bar, by hamr's ruling (addendum 3). This module does
//      not chase precision; it reports honestly at the precision it has.
//
// Unbounded is a REAL state, not a large number: hamr ruled `maxWallMs` has no
// default, so a run without one is time-unbounded by explicit operator choice and
// says so (F45 — a defaulted cap is a silent second ceiling).

 * timeout exists to bound a HANG, not to enforce the budget's last second.

 * `TIMEOUT_CODE` it carries no `category`, so every default-to-transport catch site

/**
 * F64 — is this throw the run's OWN deadline coming back dressed as a provider
 * error? `callTimeoutMs()` hands the provider a bound derived from the wall, so
 * when the wall is what shrank that bound, the resulting `TimeoutError` is a
 * GOVERNANCE stop, not a casualty. Filing it as `provider-red` would discard it
 * (a casualty is never evidence, F45/F48) and attach the F44
 * `spendComplete:false` floor to a run that simply ran out of time.
 *
 * The discriminator is the wall itself, not the derived number: on a bounded
 * clock a trip can only precede expiry when the bound came from the provider's
 * own default (`remainingMs() > PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS`), and that case is transport
 * by construction. So "already expired" IS the wall-derived set. An unbounded run
 * can never produce one, and needs no separate `bounded` term to say so —
 * `expired()` is false by construction with no cap. (A mutation run proved the
 * extra term inert; the unbounded case is guarded by its own test instead, which
 * is where that invariant belongs.)
 *
 * A genuine dead socket on a run whose wall has ALSO passed reads as a wall-halt.
 * That is deliberate and honest: the run is out of time either way, the remedy is
 * the same (raise `maxWallMs`), and the alternative — calling a governance stop
 * transport on the chance that it was — is the failure this closes.
 *
 * BOTH derived bounds land here, because both are derived from the same wall:
 * BA-18's idle timeout (`callTimeoutMs`) and BA-19's total-duration deadline
 * (`callDeadlineMs`). Adding the second CODE does not widen the rule — the
 * discriminator is still `clock.expired()`, never the code. That matters for the
 * deadline specifically: a provider someone else constructed with its own
 * `deadlineMs` could throw this code on a run with time left, and that is transport,
 * exactly as it was before.
 *
 * @param {any} err the throw as caught
 * @param {Clock} clock the run's clock
