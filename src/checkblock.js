// THE CHECK BLOCK of a rubric job (hamr 2026-11-12: "goal again is simplfication and one flow one place ai suggestes ! code adds $ and code decides what worked/doable").
// ONE store: `rows`. Nothing else holds a check. Rows are `~` (the person's own rule), `!` (the agent's suggestion: a look fact, or an AI edit) and `$` (code's defaults).
// The AI's whole part is a list of proposed ROW EDITS; code judges each edit alone, matches every row against the saved page, builds every check through the bareguard-backed
// shapes, and says why a row it cannot build is Not checked. The block never removes a row: only the person (`applyAnswer`) or code (`match`) changes one.
//   fromJob -> addLook -> reconcile( match -> build -> ask ), then, while a question is open or a reply waits: apply it and reconcile the WHOLE list again.
// Pure: no I/O, no clock, no model. Rubric jobs only (repo jobs never run through it).
