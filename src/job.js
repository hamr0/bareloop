/**
 * The staged close (PRD v1.28) — the close is an ORDERED LIST of named stages,
 * and the check menu DERIVES from it. The principle: *the user authors the
 * destination, never the road.* A user who cannot describe a workflow can still
 * say what done looks like, and everything downstream of that is derived — which
 * is why `checks[]` no longer exists as a field (hamr: *"there shouldn't be user
 * authoring anywhere, that defies the point of bareloop"*).
 *
 * Two stage classes cannot be handed to the agent as a mid-build ruler, and F58
 * measured both against a real close:
 *  - a PRECONDITION ("the seed commit exists") is not a ruler for the work; run
 *    as a check it passes instantly and teaches nothing. It sets `offer: false`.
 *  - a stage that reads what an EARLIER stage built ("the public API matches the
 *    emitted declarations") reds on its own for a reason that has nothing to do
 *    with the worker's edit. It names `needs`, and picking it runs that chain first.
 * Everything else is offerable: derivation gave job #5 SEVEN rulers where the
 * operator had hand-carved three (F58) — removing the operator does not cost the
 * agent rulers, it hands it more.
 *
 * The `needs` expansion is TRANSITIVE (fixed point, not one level): a
 * prerequisite may itself name one, and running an incomplete chain reproduces
 * the exact false-red `needs` exists to remove, one level deeper. The expanded
 * chain is ordered by the CLOSE, never by the order names were typed —
 * validateStagedClose forces `needs` to name EARLIER stages, so close order IS
 * a topological order. A `needs` cycle is inexpressible in a validated close for
 * that same reason; the walk is still cycle-safe by construction (each stage is
 * collected at most once), because a pure exported helper must terminate on
 * whatever it is handed rather than hang the runner before any token burns.
 *
 * @param {any[]} close the validated stage list
 * @returns {{name: string, run: any[]}[]} offerable stages, each with the ordered
 *   chain that must run for it (prerequisites first, the stage itself last)
