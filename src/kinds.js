// THE KIND EXECUTOR — close-authoring v1, module M1 (design record
// 2026-08-07, gate-1 Result 3; gate-2 POC closed 2026-08-08).
//
// A close stops being a hand-written script and becomes a DECLARATION over
// kinds whose implementations we own. This module is those implementations.
// The agent never authors a stage body — it parameterises four kinds, and
// anything it could not say here it cannot make the arbiter do (the
// `check-passes(name)` move: illegal is inexpressible, not rejected late).
//
// The four kinds are the small part. The load-bearing part is the THREE
// RUNTIME CONTRACTS every kind inherits — they live HERE, in the executor,
// never in a kind, and no declaration can weaken them:
//
//   (a) THE INSTRUMENT-STOP CONTRACT. exit 97 with `judged` deliberately
//       WITHHELD — for a timeout, a null exit code, unreadable or
//       unparseable required output, a buffer overrun, a missing seed
//       commit, a region anchor that located nothing, and a `first` term
//       that was never reported. A broken instrument is a CASUALTY, never a
//       red (F45); a close that reports one as a red manufactures fake
//       evidence, and the judged floor (F17) is what makes the difference
//       visible downstream. The sharp edge is the zero-match split: `sum`
//       over nothing is a COUNTED zero (the region was searched), `first`
//       over nothing is UNKNOWN — and unknown is never zero (F6).
//
//   (b) THE GAP OUTPUT CONTRACT. Every line carries the spec's `gapKeep`, a
//       trim is ANNOUNCED with its counts and never silent (F28 — a bound
//       that eats the failure names deletes exactly the mechanical detail
//       that converts, F38/F46), and no culprit is named beyond what the
//       instrument itself reported.
//
//   (c) THE CHANGED-SET PRIMITIVE. `git diff --name-only <seed>` PLUS
//       untracked files, MINUS two arbiter books. Both exclusions were paid
//       for live: the `gate-audit.jsonl` one red-carded the arbiter's own
//       file mid-run (u-msdonzxl) and burned a run to the wall. No user
//       could know to exclude them, which is why they sit below the stage
//       level in a shared primitive rather than in anyone's parameters.
//
// D12 rides on top of (a): the close stores the COUNTING RULE, never the
// number. `baseline: "seed"` is MEASURED at this run's own seed every run —
// in a detached worktree, or in place when the tree is verifiably identical
// to the seed — and WHICH route was taken is recorded (`baselineSource`),
// never silent. A frozen constant would judge run 5 against run 1's tree.
//
// Two deliberate divergences from the gate-2 POC executor, both for shipped
// reasons (this module is a graduation — a rewrite, never a copy):
//   - it is ASYNC. `spawnSync` blocks the host event loop for the child's
//     whole duration (F68 measured 9 loop freezes in one green run, worst
//     74.3s), which is precisely when the stall fuse's timers cannot fire.
//     Only the WAIT is async; every observable semantic is spawnSync's.
//   - seed worktrees live in a caller-scoped holder under the OS temp dir
//     and are removed, never in a module-global cache inside the package.
//
// Secrets: this module does NOT scrub. A stage's output is redacted by the
// CALLER at the emission boundary, through the one `SECRET_PATTERNS`
// inventory, before anything reaches the append-only spine — the same split
// `src/exits.js` documents. The env handed to the child IS blinded here,
// because a stage runs worker-authored code (`npm test`, `pytest`) and the
// operator's credentials have no business in it: `CLOSE_ENV_DENY` is
// imported from the arbiter's shell, never re-spelled — two inventories are
// two instruments.

 *   call's cost is reported OUT through it, once per call, on every route including
 *   the red ones — a paid call that leaves no meter record is F12 in a judge's coat.
 *   `onStage` is a REPORTING seam and nothing else: the seed read spawns a real
 *   toolchain per stage (a suite is the slow one) and a whole read is one opaque
 *   await, so the shell gets told as each stage lands. It decides nothing, it is

/**
 * Read ONE number out of a command's output, as signed arithmetic over
 * normalised terms.
 *
 * The zero-match split is contract (a), not a convenience:
 *   - `sum` over zero matches is a COUNTED zero. The region was searched and
 *     nothing was there; that is legitimately 0.
 *   - `first` over zero matches is UNKNOWN — the number was never reported —
 *     and unknown is an instrument stop, never a defaulted 0 (F6).
 *   - a region whose anchor matches nothing was never LOCATED: stop.
 * The scope filter runs per OUTPUT LINE, before aggregation, and both its
 * drop count and its unattributable count are ANNOUNCED: a line naming no
 * path is KEPT (no filter can exclude what it cannot locate) and the notes
 * say so, rather than the number quietly meaning something else.
 *
 * `preScopeMatches` is reported alongside the reading because a POST-scope
 * count cannot answer "did the tool run at all". It tallies (term, line) pairs
 * that matched BEFORE the filter judged them — kept, unattributable and dropped
 * alike — and it is the only evidence of liveness a caller has once the scope
 * has removed the whole population. It is never the number being read.
 *
 * `matched` is the KEPT lines themselves, PER TERM and index-aligned with
 * `breakdown`: entry i holds, in output order, exactly the lines term i's
 * subtotal was computed FROM. Run u-msn227nq paid for the echo — the executor
 * counted 8 real `error TS…` lines and told the worker "8 match(es)", discarding
 * every address, and a worker with a number and no file to open went looking for
 * the arbiter's own books instead.
 *
 * TWO EXCLUSIONS, both of them "this line is not what the count is made of":
 *  - a scope-DROPPED line is never in here. It was never counted, so aiming the
 *    worker at it would aim it outside its own population.
 *  - under `first`, only the line the aggregate actually READ. The later matches
 *    are real matches (`breakdown[i].matches` still counts them) but the value
 *    never contained them, and echoing them points the worker at a number that
 *    is not in the reading.
 *
 * And the GROUPING is the third: a term's sign lives in `breakdown[i]`, so lines
 * pooled flat across terms lose the one fact that says what they DID to the
 * number. A subtracted term's line rendered beside an added one reads as a wall
 * to go fix, and fixing it moves the count the wrong way. Deduplication is
 * therefore within a term only — one line matched by two terms plays two
 * arithmetic roles and is named under each. The count is computed from `values`,
 * never from this list.
 * @param {string} output @param {any[]} terms normalised terms
 * Every stop here is `crashed` in the arbiter's vocabulary — the command RAN,
 * came back, and the number could not be read out of it. Nothing in this
 * function can observe a spawn failure, a timeout or a signal, so it never
 * claims one.

    // `excludePrefixes:["src/"]`; post-scope the count was 0 and a good close

/**
 * WHICH ANSWER IS THIS LEG ACTING ON — the fresh one, or the one the checkpoint
 * held? F102's cure needs one seam that can say, because two callers ask the same
 * question (`runJob` declares the fold on `job-start` before `runPlan` reads the
 * ruling at all), and two spellings of "is this a fresh engagement" is how the
 * record and the clock come to disagree about the same leg.
 *
 * THE AMBIGUITY IS REFUSED, NEVER MERGED. A checkpoint that holds a decision and a
 * command line that carries another are two answers to one question. Merging them
 * picks a winner nobody chose; overriding silently discards words a person typed
 * (the F98/F28 class at a process boundary). So it comes back as a refusal that
 * NAMES the held decision, and the operator resolves it — by answering the held
 * one, or by starting a fresh run against the tree as it stands.
 *
 * `fresh` is F103's half: a `rerun` is a FRESH ENGAGEMENT (design record §3.4 —
 * *"redo/rerun comes with new authoring for money+time and keeps accounting of
 * this far and this session separate counters"*), and nothing else is. An `accept`
 * commissions no work and a `pause` runs nothing, so neither opens one.
 *
 * A REVIEW DOOR's rerun (module 8) is the SAME fact arriving one level out, and it
 * is folded in here rather than beside the clock, because "is this a fresh
 * engagement" gets ONE spelling — a second one is how a record and a clock come to
 * disagree about the same leg, which is the very thing this resolver exists to
 * prevent. It is deliberately NOT read as a ruling: a `humanRuling` answers a
 * close's human STAGE and is refused for a close that has none, so the door's words
 * stay in their own parameter and only this reading is shared.
 *
 * PRECEDENCE, stated because both CAN be handed to one leg: a door rerun makes the
 * engagement fresh whatever the ruling says, and the two are OR'd, never merged.
 * Freshness is the FAIL-SAFE direction — a fresh clock costs a leg nothing, while
 * inheriting a dead leg's wall is F103's measured, structurally-impossible
 * engagement. The door's own validation (empty words are refused) stays where it
 * is, at the seam that accepts it.
 * @param {any} fresh the answer arriving on this invocation (`--decide`), or null
 * @param {any} held the answer the CHECKPOINT carries (`readResume`'s
 *   `restart.pendingDecision`), or null. `receivedAt` is when the PERSON said it —
 *   carried through so the resumed leg records the receipt, not its own re-reading.
 * @param {any} [doorRerun] MODULE 8 — the review door's rerun, when this leg IS the
 *   fresh engagement a signer commissioned at a previous run's door. Presence is the
 *   whole of what is read here; the words are the accepting seam's business.

/**
 * THE JUDGED FLOOR (softgreen module 2) — the one kind that BUYS its measurement.
 *
 * It is `src/judged.js`'s two halves wired into the close, and the split is the
 * whole safety argument: LOCATE is a pinned, toolless model asked for facts with
 * addresses over the AUTHORITATIVE artifact, and DECIDE is a pure arbiter-owned
 * function with no model in it. The judge never renders a verdict; this runner
 * renders it, from an owned rulebook, over quotes the artifact must contain.
 *
 * FOUR ROUTES OUT, and which is which is the load-bearing part:
 *
 *   - GREEN / RED come from `decide()` alone. A red is CONTENT — facts in hand,
 *     and a card item those facts do not satisfy (or cannot be sure about, since
 *     unsure is red). That is evidence about the tree.
 *   - AN INSTRUMENT STOP is everything else: a card this arbiter cannot read, an
 *     artifact that will not open, no judge seam wired, and — after the ladder —
 *     a judge whose emission never parsed or whose call never came back.
 *     Contract (a) names "unreadable or unparseable required output" as a stop in
 *     so many words, and the reason is the casualty rule: our judge producing
 *     garbage says nothing whatsoever about the worker, and grading a tree red on
 *     it would be manufactured evidence (F45).
 *   - A `pricing-red` locate is that same stop with the retry REFUSED: an
 *     unpriced call cannot be summed, and buying a second one only adds more
 *     spend nobody can see (F6).
 *
 * The gap is ITEMIZED (ruling 7, F38/F39): named card items, per-file, with the
 * function names and the instrument's own quotes — never one paragraph. It rides
 * the same `Gap` bound as every other kind, so the trim is announced.
 *
 * EVERY path is judged, not just up to the first red, for the same reason
 * `decide()` grades every item: calibration reads itemized reds, and a stage that
 * short-circuits reports the first thing it found rather than what is true.
 * `firstRed` still names the deciding item in DECLARED order, so the verdict's
 * reason is stable against whatever order a model emitted anything in.
 *
 * NOT WIRED, AND NAMED RATHER THAN SILENTLY SKIPPED — `judgeToAnnotation` →
 * `gate.annotate` (the slice-2 obligation list, item 4). Two independent reasons,
 * either of which alone would defer it:
 *   (1) THE ADAPTER TAKES A VERDICT. bare-agent's `judgeToAnnotation` maps a
 *       `judge()` verdict (`{verdict, where:{field, stated, returned}}`) onto the
 *       annotation shape, and this pipe deliberately never buys a verdict from a
 *       model — LOCATE returns facts, and the verdict is `decide()`'s. Feeding it
 *       a synthesised verdict would annotate the gate with a judgement no judge
 *       made, which is the one thing the locate-not-verdict split exists to stop.
 *   (2) THERE IS NO GATE HERE. A Gate is built per WORKER step (`mkWorker`,
 *       src/planrun.js) and is gone by the time the close runs; the close is
 *       deliberately outside every worker's fence. Annotating "the arbiter's own
 *       gate" needs a run-scoped gate that does not exist today, and inventing
 *       one to carry an annotation would be plumbing built for its own sake.
 * The facts themselves are NOT lost meanwhile: every per-path reading (verdict,
 * itemized reds, the ladder, the scrubbed raw) rides `detail.perPath`.
