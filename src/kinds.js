// THE KIND EXECUTOR — close-authoring v1, module M1 (design record
// 2026-08-07, gate-1 Result 3; gate-2 POC closed 2026-08-08).
//
// A close stops being a hand-written script and becomes a DECLARATION over
// kinds whose implementations we own. This module is those implementations.
// The agent never authors a stage body — it parameterises four kinds, and
// anything it could not say here it cannot make the arbiter do (the
// `check-passes(name)` move: illegal is inexpressible, not rejected late).
//
// The four kinds are the small part. The load-bearing part is the THREE
// RUNTIME CONTRACTS every kind inherits — they live HERE, in the executor,
// never in a kind, and no declaration can weaken them:
//
//   (a) THE INSTRUMENT-STOP CONTRACT. exit 97 with `judged` deliberately
//       WITHHELD — for a timeout, a null exit code, unreadable or
//       unparseable required output, a buffer overrun, a missing seed
//       commit, a region anchor that located nothing, and a `first` term
//       that was never reported. A broken instrument is a CASUALTY, never a
//       red (F45); a close that reports one as a red manufactures fake
//       evidence, and the judged floor (F17) is what makes the difference
//       visible downstream. The sharp edge is the zero-match split: `sum`
//       over nothing is a COUNTED zero (the region was searched), `first`
//       over nothing is UNKNOWN — and unknown is never zero (F6).
//
//   (b) THE GAP OUTPUT CONTRACT. Every line carries the spec's `gapKeep`, a
//       trim is ANNOUNCED with its counts and never silent (F28 — a bound
//       that eats the failure names deletes exactly the mechanical detail
//       that converts, F38/F46), and no culprit is named beyond what the
//       instrument itself reported.
//
//   (c) THE CHANGED-SET PRIMITIVE. `git diff --name-only <seed>` PLUS
//       untracked files, MINUS two arbiter books. Both exclusions were paid
//       for live: the `gate-audit.jsonl` one red-carded the arbiter's own
//       file mid-run (u-msdonzxl) and burned a run to the wall. No user
//       could know to exclude them, which is why they sit below the stage
//       level in a shared primitive rather than in anyone's parameters.
//
// D12 rides on top of (a): the close stores the COUNTING RULE, never the
// number. `baseline: "seed"` is MEASURED at this run's own seed every run —
// in a detached worktree, or in place when the tree is verifiably identical
// to the seed — and WHICH route was taken is recorded (`baselineSource`),
// never silent. A frozen constant would judge run 5 against run 1's tree.
//
// Two deliberate divergences from the gate-2 POC executor, both for shipped
// reasons (this module is a graduation — a rewrite, never a copy):
//   - it is ASYNC. `spawnSync` blocks the host event loop for the child's
//     whole duration (F68 measured 9 loop freezes in one green run, worst
//     74.3s), which is precisely when the stall fuse's timers cannot fire.
//     Only the WAIT is async; every observable semantic is spawnSync's.
//   - seed worktrees live in a caller-scoped holder under the OS temp dir
//     and are removed, never in a module-global cache inside the package.
//
// Secrets: this module does NOT scrub. A stage's output is redacted by the
// CALLER at the emission boundary, through the one `SECRET_PATTERNS`
// inventory, before anything reaches the append-only spine — the same split
// `src/exits.js` documents. The env handed to the child IS blinded here,
// because a stage runs worker-authored code (`npm test`, `pytest`) and the
// operator's credentials have no business in it: `CLOSE_ENV_DENY` is
// imported from the arbiter's shell, never re-spelled — two inventories are
// two instruments.

/**
 * Read ONE number out of a command's output, as signed arithmetic over
 * normalised terms.
 *
 * The zero-match split is contract (a), not a convenience:
 *   - `sum` over zero matches is a COUNTED zero. The region was searched and
 *     nothing was there; that is legitimately 0.
 *   - `first` over zero matches is UNKNOWN — the number was never reported —
 *     and unknown is an instrument stop, never a defaulted 0 (F6).
 *   - a region whose anchor matches nothing was never LOCATED: stop.
 * The scope filter runs per OUTPUT LINE, before aggregation, and both its
 * drop count and its unattributable count are ANNOUNCED: a line naming no
 * path is KEPT (no filter can exclude what it cannot locate) and the notes
 * say so, rather than the number quietly meaning something else.
 *
 * `preScopeMatches` is reported alongside the reading because a POST-scope
 * count cannot answer "did the tool run at all". It tallies (term, line) pairs
 * that matched BEFORE the filter judged them — kept, unattributable and dropped
 * alike — and it is the only evidence of liveness a caller has once the scope
 * has removed the whole population. It is never the number being read.
 *
 * `matched` is the KEPT lines themselves, PER TERM and index-aligned with
 * `breakdown`: entry i holds, in output order, exactly the lines term i's
 * subtotal was computed FROM. Run u-msn227nq paid for the echo — the executor
 * counted 8 real `error TS…` lines and told the worker "8 match(es)", discarding
 * every address, and a worker with a number and no file to open went looking for
 * the arbiter's own books instead.
 *
 * TWO EXCLUSIONS, both of them "this line is not what the count is made of":
 *  - a scope-DROPPED line is never in here. It was never counted, so aiming the
 *    worker at it would aim it outside its own population.
 *  - under `first`, only the line the aggregate actually READ. The later matches
 *    are real matches (`breakdown[i].matches` still counts them) but the value
 *    never contained them, and echoing them points the worker at a number that
 *    is not in the reading.
 *
 * And the GROUPING is the third: a term's sign lives in `breakdown[i]`, so lines
 * pooled flat across terms lose the one fact that says what they DID to the
 * number. A subtracted term's line rendered beside an added one reads as a wall
 * to go fix, and fixing it moves the count the wrong way. Deduplication is
 * therefore within a term only — one line matched by two terms plays two
 * arithmetic roles and is named under each. The count is computed from `values`,
 * never from this list.
 * @param {string} output @param {any[]} terms normalised terms
 * Every stop here is `crashed` in the arbiter's vocabulary — the command RAN,
 * came back, and the number could not be read out of it. Nothing in this
 * function can observe a spawn failure, a timeout or a signal, so it never
 * claims one.
 * @param {{scope?: any, workdir?: string}} [o]

    // already stops on zero matches; `sum` did not, and the exit code the
    // measurement was already carrying was never consulted.
    //
    // So: zero matched AND a non-zero exit is could-not-run — the existing stop
    // lane, in BOTH directions. A crash that would have flattered the count and
    // one that would have faked a red are the same casualty, and a casualty is
    // never evidence either way (F45). Non-zero exit WITH matches stays a normal
    // reading: that is a checker reporting real findings, which is its job.

    // guard. A POST-scope count cannot tell a dead tool from a live one whose
    // every finding belonged to another population — they are TWO DIFFERENT
    // FAULTS and they read as one, the same class the `first` aggregate's own
    // stop already split above. Run mslsnnzk paid for it twice: tsc exited 2
    // and printed 67 real error lines, all under `src/`, against a stage scoped
    // `excludePrefixes:["src/"]`; post-scope the count was 0 and a good close
    // was refused as a crashed instrument. So liveness is read where liveness
    // lives — BEFORE the filter — and a live tool over an empty population is a
    // counted zero carrying the filter's own dropped-line note, which is what
    // the paragraph above always claimed and the code did not do. The fail-safe
    // is untouched in the direction that matters: a genuinely silent non-zero
    // exit still matched nothing pre-scope, and still stops.
    //
    // ACCEPTED LIMIT, stated rather than fixed. Some tools spell "I found
    // nothing" as a NON-ZERO EXIT — `grep -c` exits 1 on no match, pytest exits
    // 5 when it collects no tests. Declared as a count stage, one of those would
    // stop here instead of recording a true zero. No such misfire is
    // CONSTRUCTIBLE on the shipped TYPES genre (mypy and tsc exit 0 on a clean
    // tree and print the "found 0 errors" line the parser matches), so today the
    // rule can only produce a false STOP, never a false green — and that is
    // exactly the direction it is chosen for. A stop is loud, honest and

    // GREEN. The F49 precedent governs: the fail-safe direction is never traded
    // away to chase the sharper one, and this default is not softened.
