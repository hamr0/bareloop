/**
 * THE ONE MONEY-CEILING PREDICATE, for the same reason `priceOf` above is one:
 * the authoring pipeline meters two populations of paid call in two different
 * accumulators (the survey's `calls[]`, the declaration loop's cost book), and
 * two hand-spelled answers to "am I over the ceiling?" is two instruments.
 *
 * It is asked BETWEEN metered calls and never inside one. A cap that binds
 * mid-call kills the row before it can be graded — F45 measured that as 3 of 7
 * launches lost and $5.82 unreadable.
 *
 * Three answers, and the order between the last two is load-bearing:
 *   - NO CEILING → null, always. An absent cap is UNBOUNDED, and unbounded is a
 *     visible operator choice, never a defaulted number nobody set (the
 *     `maxWallMs` precedent). There is nothing to enforce, so unpriced spend
 *     here is merely reported.
 *   - KNOWN SPEND AT OR OVER THE CEILING → `cap-halt`, even when the total is
 *     unknown. The breach is CERTAIN on the priced half alone — whatever the
 *     unpriced remainder turns out to be, it can only be larger — so naming this
 *     `pricing-red` would send the operator to fix a meter when the fact is that
 *     the money is gone. At-or-over rather than over: the next call is the one
 *     that breaches, and it is the one being decided.
 *   - SPEND THAT CANNOT BE KNOWN → `pricing-red`. `?? 0` launders unknown into
 *     $0 (F6) and a ceiling enforced against a laundered floor is not enforced
 *     at all. If the spend cannot be seen the cap cannot govern it, and that is
 *     its own stop rather than a silent pass.
 *
 * A MALFORMED ceiling is the one input it refuses rather than answers: `null` and
 * an absent field mean UNBOUNDED, and they are the ONLY way to get there. Anything
 * else that is not a finite number (`'2.50'`, `NaN`, `Infinity`) reading as
 * unbounded would be F6's laundering in its ceiling form — a caller who set a cap
 * getting a paid pipeline with nothing enforcing it, which is the exact collapse
 * the ceiling exists to prevent, wearing the caller's own typo (PRD v1.62). The
 * CLI's `parseCeiling` guards the FLAG; this guards the LIBRARY, and `authorClose`
 * / `runAuthorScout` / `authorCloseForJob` are documented adopter seams. It THROWS
 * rather than clamping, unlike the attempt caps beside it, because those axes have
 * a safe direction to clamp toward and this one does not: every candidate default
 * is either a number nobody set or the unbounded run the caller just declined.
