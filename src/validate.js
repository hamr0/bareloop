/**
 * F49 — a heuristic reject for the catastrophic-backtracking footgun: an
 * unbounded quantifier applied to a group whose body itself repeats unboundedly
 * (`(a+)+`, `(\d*)*`, `([a-z]+){1,}`) — including through a redundant wrapping
 * group (`((a+))+`, `(?:(a+))*`), which is the SAME exponential class as `(a+)+`
 * and is caught by propagating the inner repeat up through the wrapper. Such a
 * pattern can hang `RegExp.test` for seconds on a short crafted body, and THREE
 * fields feed it to an evaluator with NO timeout — one per document:
 *   - the AGENT's `artifact-written.pattern`, run by `evalExits` (F49, the
 *     original site). Self-DoS only: the agent authors both the pattern and
 *     (via the worker) the artifact, so a hang burns only its own run's
 *     wall-clock, and there is no arbiter compromise — it cannot escape the
 *     fence, forge a green, or leak a secret.
 *   - the OPERATOR's `judged.pattern` (`runClose`) and `gapKeep` (`boundGap`),
 *     compiled and run against close output in BARELOOP'S OWN PROCESS. These
 *     are worse than an operator self-DoS, and the reason is F67's lesson: the
 *     regex blocks the MAIN EVENT LOOP, so the in-process stall fuse — a timer
 *     in that same loop — cannot fire. The run dies to the OUTSIDE watchdog and
 *     is read as a model stall, so a bad regex in a SIGNED spec presents as a
 *     provider problem. MEASURED: `boundGap(stream, '(a+)+$')` on a 40-char
 *     body does not finish in 20s.
 * So the reject targets the dominant exponential class and fails it as a
 * mechanical gap at the validation gate, before any tokens burn. A full ReDoS
 * analyzer needs a real regex engine (an external native dep we do not take for
 * a LOW issue).
 *
 * SECOND CLASS, added 2026-08-12 — OVERLAPPING ALTERNATION under an unbounded
 * repeat (`(a|aa)+`, `(a|a)+`, `(\d|\d\d)*`). F49 recorded this as a genuine
 * false NEGATIVE of the shape approach and PARKED the widening, because changing
 * the detector changes which SIGNED specs are admissible. It is closed here on
 * measurement, one fresh process per point (a hot RegExp tiers up out of the V8
 * interpreter, and a single-process sweep read a LONGER body as faster —
 * backwards for an exponential, and the harness rather than the regex).
 * `(a|aa)+$` against a run of `a` with one non-matching tail character:
 *
 *     27ch 218ms · 31ch 1,879ms · 35ch 12,082ms · 39ch 52,563ms · 41ch 189,420ms
 *
 * ~6.8× per 4 characters — the Fibonacci decomposition count, φ⁴. `(a|a)+$` (the
 * 2ⁿ equal-branch case) took 52,256ms on 27ch, and `((a|aa))+$` — the redundant
 * wrapper the `((a+))+` entry above exists for — 15,426ms on 35ch, which is why
 * the overlap propagates up through a wrapper exactly as the inner repeat does.
 * Input-bounding is theater here for F49's own reason: tens of characters suffice.
 *
 * The detected core is the PREFIX RELATION between top-level branches (one branch
 * a prefix of another, equality included — `(a|a)+` is the 2ⁿ case). Whether a
 * given prefix overlap can actually be DRIVEN exponentially depends on what
 * follows the group, and deciding that needs the real engine this file declined
 * to take as a dependency — so the reject is conservative by construction, which
 * is the fail-safe direction.
 *
 * MONOTONIC, and that is the rule this change lives under: it only ever ADDS
 * rejections. Nothing above is narrowed, and no previously-rejected shape became
 * admissible (asserted over the whole corpus in tests/plan.test.js). F49's
 * "never sharpen the detector" bars chasing false POSITIVES; closing a false
 * NEGATIVE by adding rejections is the opposite, allowed direction — distinct
 * rules, not in tension (the `((a+))+` widening set the precedent).
 *
 * SCOPE IS ASYMMETRIC, both directions named on purpose:
 *   - false POSITIVE: a group whose repetitions are disambiguated by a literal
 *     anchor/delimiter (`(?:^- .+$\n?)+`, `(?:CHANGELOG:.+\n)+`) is FLAGGED even
 *     though a real engine runs it linearly — the scan sees the nested-quantifier
 *     SHAPE, not the disambiguation. Rejecting it is the FAIL-SAFE direction (it
 *     never admits an unsafe pattern), and the cost is bounded: the plan drafter
 *     gets a mechanical gap and rewrites (drop the outer `+`, or match once).
 *     Detecting "safe because anchored" needs the same real engine we declined,
 *     and guessing it wrong would ADMIT an exponential pattern — so the shape
 *     reject stands, and the over-rejection is a named, accepted limitation.
 *
 *     The alternation class has its OWN instance of the same limit, measured and
 *     locked in `REDOS_OVERREJECTED_ALT`: `(ab|abc)+$`, `(x|xy|xyz)+$` and
 *     `(x(a|aa))+$` carry the prefix relation and did NOT blow up on the bodies
 *     measured (0.3–0.4ms at 41–91 characters). "Did not blow up on the body
 *     measured" is the honest claim — no adversarial search was run for a worse
 *     input — and rejecting them is again the direction that never admits an
 *     exponential pattern.
 *
 * The input is guaranteed to compile as a RegExp (checked first by the caller),
 * so this scan assumes valid, balanced JS regex syntax.
 * @param {string} src a compiled regex source string
 * @returns {boolean} true iff a nested unbounded quantifier, or an unboundedly

 * WHY IT EXISTS (PRD v1.60 §1, an OPEN GAP now closed). v1.55 took F49's reject
 * to the operator's own regex fields, and the admissibility sweep that backed it
 * walked `jobs/*.json`. That is not the population of signed specs: a REGISTRY
 * BRIDGE is signed the same way, ships its plans VERBATIM (reuse stores the
 * whole plan, never a template), and lives outside `jobs/`, so a pathological
 * pattern arriving through a bridge was never swept. Nothing had decided
 * bridge-borne patterns were safe — the sweep was written against the directory
 * that held every spec at the time and was never re-aimed.
 *
 * WHAT is rejected is UNCHANGED: `hasNestedQuantifier`, one inventory, shared
 * with job.js and plan.js. Only WHERE it looks is wider. Widening the DETECTOR
 * is arbiter-adjacent and stays parked (F49); widening the POPULATION is this.
 *
 * KEY-SCOPED, deliberately. `pattern` and `gapKeep` are the exactly-three regex
 * fields F49 names (`artifact-written.pattern`, `judged.pattern`, `gapKeep`);
 * every other string in a signed document is prose, a path or a command, and
 * running a regex-shape scan over prose would red goals for containing `(a+)+`
 * in a sentence. A field carrying a regex under a NEW key is not swept until
 * this list names it — stated so the limit is read rather than rediscovered.
 *
 * COMPILE-FIRST, like both per-field callers: the scan's contract is that its
