// The ONE owner of a stage's plain question ("did it change any file?", "no failing tests?"). Moved out of
// src/panel/server.js (verbatim) so the Audit/step map AND the learnings cards read the same sentence from the same
// code — a second spelling is how two screens come to disagree about one check. Pure; no file IO, no model.

/**
 * THE PLAIN-QUESTION OWNER (plain-checks build, 2026-09-28, hamr's ruling:
 * the "checks N/M" headline is WITHDRAWN — "confusing, reads like 6 failed
 * when 5 never ran"). ONE pure function mapping a declared stage's own
 * signed `kind`+`params` (plus the close's own `genre`, also a signed field)
 * to a short plain-English question a person can read without knowing the
 * catalogue — never a second spelling on the client, and never anything the
 * model authored (the catalogue's kinds/params are the whole vocabulary this
 * reads).
 *
 * Every branch is traced straight off `src/kinds.js`'s runner semantics and
 * the TYPES genre template (`src/authoring.js` `TYPES_GENRE_TEMPLATE`,
 * `classGuards`'s `MECHANICAL_GUARDS`) — never guessed:
 *   - `files-changed` is always the `changed-from-seed` guard: "did it
 *     change any file?"
 *   - `pattern-absent-in-diff` is always the `no-suppressions` guard: "no
 *     casts or silencers added?"
 *   - `rubric-step` (Part 1a) is one job line's output file: "line N — does its output pass the line's checks?"
 *   - `command-exit` is the genre's `suite-green` stage (the only shipped use
 *     of this kind): "does the test suite pass?"
 *   - `count-not-worse` splits three ways on its own declared
 *     `direction`/`baseline` (never the runtime number — see
 *     {@link stageKindMetaFromSpec}'s own doc for why the baseline KIND must
 *     travel separately from the measured figure):
 *       - `higher-is-better` + `baseline: 'seed'` is the genre's `tests-kept`
 *         floor: "did all the old tests still exist?"
 *       - `lower-is-better` + `baseline: 0` is the genre's in-scope
 *         `typecheck` stage — UNLESS its own `cmd`+`args` is the SAME
 *         command a `command-exit` stage in the same close already runs
 *         (`suiteCmdKeys`, below): the TYPES template's `suite-green` is "the
 *         suite exits clean AND reports zero failing tests — TWO assertions"
 *         over ONE population (the same `npm test`/`pytest` invocation), so a
 *         `count-not-worse` stage sharing that exact command is the failing-
 *         test-count half of that pair, never a typecheck stage: "no failing
 *         tests?" — derived from the same cmd+args correlation (the stage
 *         counts the suite's own failing tests), never from the stage's own
 *         name string. The live check that found this (run mul5fofw's own
 *         `suite-zero-failing-tests`, cmd `npm test`, same as its sibling
 *         `suite-green` command-exit stage) would otherwise have read "test/
 *         has 0 type errors?", which is false: its parser counts FAILING
 *         TESTS (`^# fail (\d+)$`), not type-checker output. hamr's ruling:
 *         name this half honestly rather than reusing "type errors" for a
 *         population it was never about, or falling back to the stage's raw
 *         name. When the command differs from every sibling `command-exit`
 *         stage, the declared `scope.includePrefixes` naming exactly ONE path
 *         is quoted verbatim (a signed param, never invented): "<path> has 0
 *         type errors?" — otherwise the generic "type errors is 0?", never a
 *         guessed filename.
 *       - `lower-is-better` + `baseline: 'seed'` with a non-empty
 *         `scope.excludePrefixes` is the genre's `typecheck-outside` ceiling:
 *         "other files didn't get more type errors?"
 * The "type errors" wording is genre-owned (`GENRE_WHAT`), because TYPES is
 * the only genre this catalogue admits today (doc-genre kinds are not yet
 * built) — an unrecognised genre, or a `count-not-worse` shape none of the
 * three above matches, returns `null` rather than invent a fourth shape.
 *
 * `null` means "no honest plain question" — the caller (buildAttemptsList,
 * partLine1Text's `attemptChecksLine`) falls back to the stage's OWN name,
 * exactly as it already does for a stage with no resolvable kind at all.
 * @param {{kind: string|null, params: any, genre: string|null, suiteCmdKeys: Set<string>}} o
 * @returns {string|null}

 * better`/`baseline: 0` stage (the failing-test-count half of `suite-green`'s
 * "two assertions"), which shares that stage's own shape but not its
 * population. `null` for a stage whose `cmd` isn't a non-empty string —
