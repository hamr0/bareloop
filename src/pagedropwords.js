// IDEA A CORE (docs/product/ITEM33-BUILD.md "Addendum 2026-10-18 — Idea A core: build spec", sections 4.6 and 7): NO SILENT DROP. The ONE place
// that writes the sentence for a word, fact or rule that a page rule dropped. The plan card, the Job tab, the confirm card and the drafter's
// block all read these words; no other file writes a drop reason (a test greps for it). Plain words, written by CODE from the drop's reason
// code, never a raw code and never model-written. `<label>` is the page's own word.
