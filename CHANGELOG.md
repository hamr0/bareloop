# Changelog

All notable changes to bareloop are documented here. Format:
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning:
[SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Pre-1.0: **minor** = a ladder rung or
feature lands, **patch** = docs, fixes, scaffolding.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- PRD **addendum v1.2**: the menu-breadth (graduated-disclosure) probe is assigned to
  adaptlearn (successor-POC track, F19/F20 style) and returns to bareloop as findings;
  the registry-gating separation requirement is unchanged.
- PRD locked at **v1** (2026-07-11) after the bloat audit: §6→§9 open-questions dedup,
  §4 secrets-never-enter-the-spine invariant, §5 mobile-responsive mandate. Amendments
  from here are dated addenda, never rewrites.
- PRD **addendum v1.1** (post-lock interview + adaptlearn cross-check): panel layout and
  web-CLI command bar; full five-package primitive disclosure with the **two-red routing
  rule** (locked-but-exists → in-loop registry admission; missing/broken → fix baresuite
  and consume, never a local shim); **graduated-disclosure** open question pre-registered
  with M3 discipline (minimal-menu vs +1-extra contrast must separate before the
  request-red registry is built) — verified never exercised in adaptlearn.
- `docs/01-product/PANEL.md` — panel spec: two panes (left chat + command bar speaking
  the exact headless-CLI verbs; right progress/cost/step over results cards); primitive
  menu grouped under recall / compress / stash / remember (provisional); context-graph
  third view reserved (consumes litectx `ContextGraph` + the spine); mobile stacks;
  headless first.
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml` — npm trusted publishing (OIDC, no token), manual
  dispatch, idempotent, asserts registry end-state.
- `bareloop.context.md` — adopter contract per LIBRARY_CONVENTIONS §3 (draft; API
  sections fill in as rungs land). `LICENSE` + `NOTICE` (Apache-2.0, matching the suite;
  corrects the 0.0.1 placeholder's MIT declaration).
- README rewritten in the bareagent shape: banner, badges, agent-first quick start,
  layers/verdict tables, science table, ladder roadmap, ecosystem section.

### Changed
- `docs/UPSTREAM-ASKS.md` repurposed: upstream-gap **fix queue** only (we own baresuite —
  fix-and-consume, version bump; request-red admissions resolve in-loop and never land
  here).
- Repo hygiene per LIBRARY_CONVENTIONS §7: `.claude/`, `.litectx/`, `.idea/` ignored and
  de-tracked; `CLAUDE.md` stays tracked as the agent-doctrine file.
- `package.json` takes the library shape: `"type": "module"`, Node `>=20` (bareguard's
  floor governs), `files` ships `src/` + `types/` + the doc set (paths land at N0);
  repository/homepage links to GitHub.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Repo cut** from the adaptlearn seed per the close-out plan (adaptlearn archived and
  closed at v0.11.1 — the science behind this product).
- **Named `bareloop`** (working dir renamed from the `looped` placeholder; `looped` and
  `reloop` verified squatted on npm). Name reserved: `bareloop@0.0.1` published to npm —
  README + package.json only, no code.
- Seed docs: PRD (named, v0.2 at the time), design record
  `docs/plans/2026-07-10-agentic-automation-successor-design.md` with the naming
  resolution annotated, adaptlearn FINDINGS F1–F20 + CYBERNETICS.md carried as closed
  records in `docs/00-context/`.
- Scaffold: `CLAUDE.md`, fresh `docs/FINDINGS.md` (numbering starts at F1),
  `docs/UPSTREAM-ASKS.md`, guardrails pre-tool hook (local), `.gitignore`.
- Public GitHub repo `hamr0/bareloop`, `main` branch.
