# Upstream asks — bare suite gaps found while building bareloop

Exercising the suite (bareagent, bareguard, litectx, barebrowse, baremobile) and fixing
what's missing upstream is an explicit secondary goal (design record §"one paragraph").
This is a **fix queue, not a log**: we own the suite, so a gap gets fixed at the repo that
owns the primitive and consumed here by version bump — never a local shim in bareloop.

Only **upstream-gap reds** (primitive missing or broken) land here. A *locked-but-exists*
request-red resolves in-loop by registry admission and never becomes an entry — the two
reds have different resolutions and must not be collapsed (PRD addendum v1.1 §3).

Format per entry: **which package · what's missing/broken · the run/finding that surfaced
it · the fix (upstream commit/PR) · the version bareloop consumed.**

## WITHDRAWN (2026-07-12) — bareguard secret redaction is already exported

Filed then withdrawn same day after reading bareguard's source. bareguard **already
exports `redact`** (BG-1 default-on: `Bearer …`/`sk-…` value patterns + key-aware
blanking), which is exactly what the spine-source scrub needs — `src/interpret.js` now
consumes it directly (`ralph.js` scrubs close output at capture; F5). No upstream change
was needed. The two "vocabularies" are a deliberate split, not drift: **validators keep
their own tuned `SECRET_RE`** because DETECTION (redding a whole spec) needs a low false-
positive rate, while **redaction tolerates false-positives** (masking a package name in a
failure log blocks nothing). bareguard's own `sk-[\w-]{16,}` has the same missing-left-
boundary the validator fix corrected — one more reason the validator does not bind it.

## OPEN (2026-07-14) — BA-1: bare-agent cannot cache a tool loop's transcript on Anthropic

**Package:** bare-agent (`src/provider-anthropic.js`) · **Severity: the biggest gap this
repo has found.** It is not a bareloop bug; it taxes *every* tool-loop agent in the suite.

**What's missing.** Anthropic does **not** auto-cache — bare-agent's own JSDoc says so
(`cacheSystem`: *"Anthropic does NOT auto-cache, so without this its cache tiers are always
0"*). But `cache_control` can only be placed on **`system`**. The `messages` array never
gets a breakpoint, and `_toAnthropicMessage()` **rebuilds** `role: 'tool'` messages into
fresh `tool_result` blocks, discarding anything a caller attached. In a tool loop the
transcript *is* the tool results (file contents from `shell_read`), and it always **ends**
on one — so there is no seam (`assemble` included) through which a caller can mark the
prefix. `cacheSystem` doesn't help: the system prompt is the ~200-token persona, below
Anthropic's ~1024-token cache minimum.

**Consequence: the loop re-buys its entire transcript at full input price, every round.**
Measured on job #1 (real litectx, real model, F18): **754,836 fresh input tokens, 0 cached,
$1.55 — and the job died at the cap without ever writing a fix.**

**The fix (≈6 lines).** Place a rolling `cache_control: {type:'ephemeral'}` on the last
content block of the last message at body-build time (Anthropic caches the whole prefix up
to the mark; rolling it forward each round keeps the growing transcript cached). Ideally
behind an opt-in flag mirroring `cacheSystem` (e.g. `cacheMessages`), defaulting **on** for
tool loops — the failure mode of *not* caching is a silent 5–10× bill.

**Evidence, measured against the real API, one knob apart** (spike:
`poc/`-class, never shipped; provider patched in a scratch COPY, `node_modules` untouched):

| | round 1 | round 2 | round 3 | round 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| today (no breakpoint) | $0.1524 | $0.1525 | $0.1525 | $0.1526 |
| with breakpoint | $0.1903 *(cache write)* | **$0.0162** | **$0.0162** | **$0.0163** |

Steady-state **9.4× cheaper per round**; the cache write (1.25×) is paid once. End to end on
job #1 the same budget bought **~4× the context throughput** (754k full-price tokens → 2.9M
cache-read tokens) and the job **greened for the first time** (1 of 2 reps; caching is
necessary, not sufficient — see BA-2).

**Fix upstream + version bump. No local shim** (design law #10): the provider is a
shell-owned binding, so bareloop *could* bind a patched copy — and must not.

## WITHDRAWN (2026-07-14) — BA-2 was MISFILED: the ranged read was never `shell_read`'s job — it is litectx's `get`

> **WITHDRAWN 2026-07-14 — wrong package; the capability exists and bareloop consumed it this
> session.** The ask was filed as "no ranged-read primitive in bare-agent's `shell_read`; the
> only route is `sed` via `shell_run`, which bareloop locks." But the ranged read was never
> `shell_read`'s job: it is **litectx's `get(path, {startLine, endLine})`**, shipped in 0.29.1
> — one content-hash-gated chunk, refusing any non-chunk-boundary range, so it cannot be
> widened into a whole-file read. bareloop consumes it as the F19 `ctx_get` tool
> (`litectx ^0.29.1`); the `run` lock is untouched, because the retrieval verbs are read-only
> by construction. The misfiling itself is the finding — **aim the ask at the right package**
> — so the original ask stays below, legible, for the record. Do NOT hand it to bare-agent.

**Package:** bare-agent (`tools/shell.js`) · job #1 runs (F18) · **the load-bearing ask.**

**What's missing.** `shell_read`'s only sizing knob is **`maxBytes`** — a cap measured from
**byte zero**. There is no `offset`, no line range. So a worker can hold a perfect pointer
("the bug is in `tokenize.js:66-72`") and have **no way to act on it**. Its only move is to
swallow the whole file.

**Why it cannot be worked around here, and why that is correct.** There *is* one way to read
lines 66-72 today: `sed -n '66,72p'` — which needs `shell_run`, and bareloop **locks `run` on
purpose** (a worker that can run commands can run its own close; that is the arbiter, design
law #1). The worker is caught between a fence we *want* and a primitive we never built. This
is two-red routing at its cleanest: a **missing primitive → fix upstream**, emphatically NOT
an argument for admitting `run`.

**Consequence (measured).** The control run read `src/store.js` (117 KB) **nine times** and
`src/index.js` (90 KB) three times — **1.37 MB of source** dragged through context to find a
one-character bug in a 3.4 KB function. It was not being stupid: it was paging through a file
with a tool that has no pager. With caching wired (BA-1) it simply thrashes *longer* — the
failing rep re-read the same 7 files **42 of 49 reads (86%)**.

**The fix.** Add a range to `shell_read` — `offset`/`limit` in bytes, or (better for source)
`startLine`/`endLine`, which is the unit litectx already indexes in. Everything else in the
retrieval story is downstream of this one.

## OPEN (2026-07-14) — BA-3: `loop.stop()` returns a bogus hard-limit error and discards the run's text

**Package:** bare-agent (`src/loop.js`) · surfaced by the F20 attempt bound · **the wart that
made the fix ugly.**

**What's broken.** A caller that stops the round loop deliberately — `loop.stop()` from an
`onLlmResult` handler — breaks bare-agent's internal `while`, which then **falls through to the
`HARD_ROUND_LIMIT` return path**. So a *deliberate* stop comes back as
`{text: '', error: "[Loop] hit internal safety limit of N rounds"}` — **indistinguishable from
a runaway, and it DISCARDS the worker's text.** bareloop bounds a tool-mode attempt by calling
`stop()` at its per-attempt round bound (F20); read literally, that return escalated
`interpreter-red` and killed the whole run at attempt 1 — the bound would have ended the
attempt and killed the loop in the same breath.

**The workaround (local, in bareloop).** A `stoppedByBound` flag: bareloop KNOWS it stopped the
loop, so it ignores the bogus error and keeps its own accounting. It works, but it is a shim
around a lib that reports a caller's intent as a fault. plan-v1 removes bareloop's need for it
(a fresh Gate per step makes `limits.maxTurns` the native step bound), but the wart still taxes
any other suite consumer that stops a loop on purpose.

**The fix.** A stop requested via `stop()` must return `error: null` and **keep the run's
accumulated text** — a caller-initiated halt is not a safety-limit failure and must not be
reported as one.

**Acceptance criteria (must be able to fail).** A scripted loop stopped via `stop()` at round N
returns `error: null` **and** non-empty `text` (the text produced through round N). Without the
fix, `error` is the hard-limit string and `text` is empty — that is the failing assertion.

**Fix upstream + version bump. No local shim** in the shipped path (design law #10); the
`stoppedByBound` flag is the honest interim and is documented as such (F20).

## CLOSED (2026-07-14) — LC-1 [REVISED]: recall's hit is too thin to triage, and its body is unreachable

> **CLOSED 2026-07-14 — litectx's decline is CONFIRMED by our own trace; triage is not the
> bottleneck.** Part 2 (fetch one chunk) **shipped**: litectx 0.29.1's `get(path, {startLine,
> endLine})` returns exactly one content-hash-gated chunk (code + docstring), refusing any
> non-chunk-boundary range — consumed by bareloop (`litectx ^0.29.1`, F19). Part 1 (a snippet
> on the hit) litectx **declined on measurement** (a 400 B chunk-head snippet costs 2.8× on
> every recall; full bodies 27.9×), setting an un-defer condition: a trace showing the worker
> electing **>2 wrong fetches per recall** (i.e. triage, not action, is the bottleneck). **Our
> F19 trace ANSWERS it and confirms the decline: 0.2 fetches per recall (34 recalls / 10 gets;
> `ctx_get` ok=9, no-chunk=1).** Triage is emphatically not where the run is stuck — the worker
> searched the wrong subsystem entirely (F21), which a fatter hit would not have cured. litectx
> also correctly did NOT ship `get({path, symbol})`: 92% of our code chunks have no symbol
> (arrow functions) and duplicate names would silently return the wrong body — `get` by
> line-range is the right primitive. Entry closes.

**Package:** litectx (`src/store.js`, recall/get surface) · job #1 runs (F18).
**Revised 2026-07-14 after hamr pushed back — the first draft of this ask was wrong**, and
the correction is worth keeping: it asked recall to return **full bodies for every hit**,
which would re-create the exact bloat this whole finding is about. Measured against this
repo's index: a `recall(n=5)` that hit the fat tail would dump **61,402 B ≈ 15,350 tokens**
into context *unbidden* — a whole-file read wearing a different hat. (Chunk sizes: median
295 B, p90 1.9 KB, **max 18.8 KB**.) **A search index returns pointers; the caller decides
what to pay for.** That design was right; my ask was not.

**What's actually missing — two bounded things:**

1. **A snippet on the hit, so it can be triaged without fetching.** Today a hit carries
   `path · symbol · nodeType · startLine · endLine · score` — no signature, no prose. The
   worker cannot tell which of five hits is the one. Return the **head of the chunk** (a few
   hundred bytes): with **LC-2** landed that head *is* the docstring + signature, so this
   costs one fix, not two.
2. **A way to fetch ONE chunk.** `get` takes a path and reads **the whole file fresh from
   disk**. The body is already in SQLite — `nodes(path, kind, symbol, node_type, start_line,
   end_line, **body TEXT NOT NULL**)`. Expose `get({path, symbol})` (or by node id) to return
   that single chunk. This is **exposure, not new capability**.

Together with **BA-2** this closes the loop: `recall` says *where* and *roughly what*, one
`get` (or one ranged read) pulls *just that* — 7 lines instead of 117 KB.

## WITHDRAWN (2026-07-14) — LC-2 was OUR ERROR, not a defect: a stale index, never a dropped docstring

> **WITHDRAWN 2026-07-14 — this was a phantom, and the root cause is a live footgun in OUR
> environment, not litectx.** Docstring attachment had been fixed upstream long before we
> filed this; the missing docstrings we measured came from a **stale index that had never
> re-chunked**. hamr's GLOBAL `~/.claude/settings.json` runs a `SessionStart` hook
> (`.../node_modules/litectx/integrations/claude/warm-index.sh`) against a **globally-installed
> litectx v0.5.0**, while every repo imports its own node_modules copy (bareloop: 0.29.1) — a
> **24-version skew, and the OLD one writes the index in every repo hamr opens.** 0.29.1
> self-heals on read (it stamps a hash of its own source in `PRAGMA user_version` and rebuilds
> when the chunker changes), but the 0.5.0 hook re-poisons the index at every session start.
> Fix is local, not upstream: `npm i -g litectx@0.29.1`. This is the "stale index manufactures
> phantom defects" lesson, paid for with a false high-severity bug report. The defect
> description below is **retained for the record only** — do NOT hand it to litectx.

**Package:** litectx (`src/chunker.js`) · **found by hamr**, confirmed against the index.

**What's broken.** A chunk's `body` starts at the code. Tree-sitter's `function_declaration`
node begins at the `function` keyword, so the **leading doc comment is dropped at index
time**. Verified on this repo:

```
recall('runClose') → body starts:  export function runClose(close, redact = …) {
immediately above it in source:    …the signal cannot be "zero judged"; it must be a FLOOR
                                    against a declared baseline: litectx runs ~390 tests…
```

**Consequence.** In a codebase where the *reasoning* lives in the docblock — which is every
codebase written to these rules — recall returns **what the code does with none of why**. A
worker handed `runClose` without its docblock cannot know that `cwd` is load-bearing (F8),
that a timeout is not a `broken-close` (F17), or why the judgment floor exists. The comment
IS the load-bearing part, and it is exactly what gets cut.

**The fix.** Extend a symbol chunk's range upward through an immediately-preceding comment
block (JSDoc `/** … */`, `//` run, `#` run, Python docstring already inside the body) and
include it in `body`. Same fix serves every `format` the chunker handles.

*(No other open asks from this repo.)*
